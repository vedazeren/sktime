<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">1 Introduction</a><a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>sktime is a community-oriented and -led project. We value the
involvement of everyone in the community. We are committed to creating a
friendly and respectful place for learning, teaching and contributing.
All participants in our in-person events and online communications are
expected to show respect and courtesy to others at all times.</p>
<p>To make clear what is expected, everyone participating in activities
associated with the sktime project is required to conform to this Code
of Conduct. This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the
sktime project including, but not limited to, in-person focus groups and
workshops, and communications online via GitHub.</p>
<p>The lead investigator of the sktime - Dr Franz Király - is responsible
for enforcing the Code of Conduct. He can be contacted by emailing
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:fkiraly&#37;&#52;&#48;turing&#46;ac&#46;uk">fkiraly<span>&#64;</span>turing<span>&#46;</span>ac<span>&#46;</span>uk</a>.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">2 Code of Conduct</a><a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The sktime team are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive
environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. As
such, we do not tolerate behaviour that is disrespectful to our
community members or that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to
others. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on
characteristics that include, but are not limited to: gender identity
and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy,
familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief
(or lack thereof), membership of a national minority, property, age,
education, socio-economic status, technical choices, and experience
level.</p>
<p>Everyone who participates in the sktime project activities is required
to conform to this Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct applies to all
spaces managed by the sktime project including, but not limited to, in
person focus groups and workshops, and communications online via GitHub.
By participating, contributors indicate their acceptance of the
procedures by which the sktime project core development team resolves
any Code of Conduct incidents, which may include storage and processing
of their personal information.</p>
<div class="section" id="expected-behaviour">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">2.1 Expected Behaviour</a><a class="headerlink" href="#expected-behaviour" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We are confident that our community members will together build a
supportive and collaborative atmosphere at our events and during online
communications. The following bullet points set out explicitly what we
hope you will consider to be appropriate community guidelines:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences</strong>. Do not
engage in homophobic, racist, transphobic, ageist, ableist, sexist,
or otherwise exclusionary behaviour.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use welcoming and inclusive language</strong>. Exclusionary comments or
jokes, threats or violent language are not acceptable. Do not address
others in an angry, intimidating, or demeaning manner. Be considerate
of the ways the words you choose may impact others. Be patient and
respectful of the fact that English is a second (or third or fourth!)
language for some participants.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do not harass people</strong>. Harassment includes unwanted physical
contact, sexual attention, or repeated social contact. Know that
consent is explicit, conscious and continuous—not implied. If you are
unsure whether your behaviour towards another person is welcome, ask
them. If someone tells you to stop, do so.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Respect the privacy and safety of others</strong>. Do not take photographs
of others without their permission. Do not share other participant’s
personal experiences without their express permission. Note that
posting (or threatening to post) personally identifying information
of others without their consent (“doxing”) is a form of harassment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be considerate of others’ participation</strong>. Everyone should have an
opportunity to be heard. In update sessions, please keep comments
succinct so as to allow maximum engagement by all participants. Do
not interrupt others on the basis of disagreement; hold such comments
until they have finished speaking.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Don’t be a bystander</strong>. If you see something inappropriate
happening, speak up. If you don’t feel comfortable intervening but
feel someone should, please feel free to ask a member of the Code of
Conduct response team for support.</p></li>
<li><p>As an overriding general rule, please <strong>be intentional in your
actions and humble in your mistakes</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All interactions should be professional regardless of platform: either
online or in-person. See <a class="reference external" href="https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules">this explanation of the four social
rules</a> - no
feigning surprise, no well-actually’s, no back-seat driving, no subtle
-isms - for further recommendations for inclusive behaviours.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">2.2 Unacceptable Behaviour</a><a class="headerlink" href="#unacceptable-behaviour" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Examples of unacceptable behaviour by sktime community members at any
project event or platform include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people
on the basis of membership of any specific group</p></li>
<li><p>causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking,
following, or intimidation</p></li>
<li><p>violent threats or language directed against another person</p></li>
<li><p>the display of sexual or violent images</p></li>
<li><p>unwelcome sexual attention</p></li>
<li><p>nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact</p></li>
<li><p>sustained disruption of talks, events or communications</p></li>
<li><p>insults or put downs</p></li>
<li><p>sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary
jokes</p></li>
<li><p>excessive swearing</p></li>
<li><p>incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm</p></li>
<li><p>continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or
recording) with someone after being asked to stop</p></li>
<li><p>publication of private communication without consent</p></li>

<p>Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are
expected to comply immediately. This applies to all sktime community
events and platforms, either online or in-person. If a participant
engages in behaviour that violates this Code of Conduct, any member of

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id16">4.2 Urgent Situations: Acting Unilaterally</a><a class="headerlink" href="#urgent-situations-acting-unilaterally" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If the incident involves physical danger, or involves a threat to
anyone’s safety (e.g. threats of violence), any member of the community
may – and should – act unilaterally to protect the safety of any
community member. This can include contacting law enforcement (or other
local personnel) and speaking on behalf of the sktime team.</p>
<p>If the act is ongoing, any community member may act immediately, before
reaching consensus, to diffuse the situation. In ongoing situations, any
member may at their discretion employ any of the tools available in this
enforcement manual, including bans and blocks online, or removal from a
physical space.</p>
<p>In situations where an individual community member acts unilaterally,
they must inform Dr Franz Király as soon as possible, and report their
actions for review within 24 hours.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id17">4.3 Less-Urgent Situations</a><a class="headerlink" href="#less-urgent-situations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Upon receiving a report of an incident, the Code of Conduct committee
will review the incident and determine, to the best of her ability:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>whether this is an ongoing situation</p></li>
<li><p>whether there is a threat to anyone’s physical safety</p></li>
<li><p>what happened</p></li>
<li><p>whether this event constitutes a Code of Conduct violation</p></li>
<li><p>who, if anyone, was the bad actor</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This information will be collected either in person or in writing. The
Code of Conduct committee will provide a written summary of the
information surrounding the incident. All participants will be
anonymised in the summary report, referred to as “Community Member 1”,
“Community Member 2”, or “Research Team Member 1”. The “de-anonymising
key” will be kept in a separate file and only accessed to link repeated
reports against the same person over time.</p>
<p>The Code of Conduct committee will aim to have a resolution agreed upon
within one week. In the event that a resolution can’t be determined in
that time, a member of the Code of Conduct committee will respond to the
reporter(s) with an update and projected timeline for resolution.</p>

<div class="section" id="resolutions">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id18">4.4 Resolutions</a><a class="headerlink" href="#resolutions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Code of Conduct committee will seek to agree on a resolution by
consensus of all members investigating the report in question. If the
committee cannot reach consensus and deadlocks for over a week, Dr Franz
Király, as lead investigator of the sktime project, will break the tie.
If Dr Franz Király is unable to take part in the discussion due to a
conflict of interest, Dr Tony Bagnall, as an external member of the Code
of Conduct committee, will make the decision.</p>
<p>Possible responses may include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A mediated conversation or agreement between the impacted community
members.</p></li>
<li><p>A request for a verbal or written apology, public or private, from a
community member.</p></li>
<li><p>A public announcement clarifying community responsibilities under the
Code of Conduct.</p></li>
<li><p>Nothing, if the issue reported is not a violation or outside of the
scope of this Code of Conduct.</p></li>
<li><p>A private in-person conversation between a member of the research
team and the individual(s) involved. In this case, the person who has
the conversation will provide a written summary for record keeping.</p></li>
<li><p>A private written reprimand from a member of the research team to the
individual(s) involved. In this case, the research team member will
deliver that reprimand to the individual(s) over email, cc’ing Dr
Franz Király for record keeping.</p></li>
<li><p>A public announcement of an incident, ideally in the same venue that
the violation occurred (i.e. on the listserv for a listserv
violation; GitHub for a GitHub violation, etc.). The committee may
choose to publish this message elsewhere for posterity.</p></li>
<li><p>An imposed “time out” from online spaces. Dr Franz Király will
communicate this “time out” to the individual(s) involved.</p></li>
<li><p>A permanent or temporary ban from some or all sktime project spaces
(GitHub, in-person events etc). The research team will maintain
records of all such bans so that they may be reviewed in the future,
extended to a Code of Conduct safety team as it is built, or
otherwise maintained. If a member of the community is removed from an
event they will not be reimbursed for any part of the event that they
miss.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, a member of
the Code of Conduct committee will contact the original reporter and any
other affected parties and explain the proposed resolution. The Code of
Conduct committee member will ask if this resolution is acceptable, and
must note feedback for the record. However, the Code of Conduct
committee is not required to act on this feedback.</p>
